This is set of perl tests for test code quality, if all test passes we know that:
- module have valid syntax and have strict and warnings pragmas
- module have only unix line endings and not have whitespaces in the end of line
- module have no FIXME notes
- module have no soft breakpoints for perl debugger
- module have no tabs
- module is conform to our coding style (=perltidy config)
- module distribution looks good to upload to cpan
- module has portable file names
- code units in module have required cyclomatic complexity and required lines of code
- module code is conform to Perl Best Practice recommendation from Perl::Critic
- module has POD and it is valid
- POD cover all methods
- POD is written on valid human language
- the tests written for module cover needed percent of code

And we can test that module methods have no memory leaks

Using:
git clone git@github.com:worldmind/perl-test-code-quality-template.git
cd perl-test-code-quality-template/
perl Makefile.PL
make
make manifest
make test

# if you make your module based on this you can install it by
make install
